    m_Localized: "Welcome to our mobile application, created by second-year students
      of the Higher School of Information Technology and Automated Systems (HSITAS),
      including Irina Albastova, Daniil Pozdeev, Bogdan Puchkov, Nikolay Stepanov
      and Yulia Chulvashi, as part of their academic practice! We are pleased to
      present you a unique way to get acquainted with the areas of preparation of
      our school in a game format.\n\nOur goal is to introduce applicants to the
      areas of training at the Higher School of Economics and extracurricular activities
      at NARFU. With the help of our application, you can search for avatars, which,
      by pointing the camera, will receive information about various educational
      programs and activities of our higher school. It is not only exciting, but
      also informative \u2014 you will be able to learn more about what awaits you
      at our university, and what opportunities open up before you.\n\nWe also want
      to note that all avatars were generated using the DeepAI neural network, and
      the game uses Toby Fox's \"Memory\" audio material. We hope that our application
      will be a useful tool for you in choosing your future profession and will help
      you take the first step into the world of information technology!\n\nJoin us
      and discover HSITAS in a fun and interactive way!"
